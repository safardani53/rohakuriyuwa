The jury ultimately <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>found her not liable and awarded</a> her $1 and legal fees.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Paltrow, 50, was sued by retired optometrist Terry Sanderson, who <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>first filed a lawsuit against her</a> back in January 2019, following a February 2016 incident where the two collided while skiing a beginner-level slope at Deer Valley Resort.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In Sanderson's 2019 lawsuit, he accused Paltrow of colliding with him from behind while she skied with an instructor and also alleged the ski instructor filed a false report claiming Paltrow did not cause the accident at the time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A rep for Paltrow told PEOPLE at the time: "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>This lawsuit is completely without merit</a>. Anyone who reads the facts will realize that." Paltrow also <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>denied the allegations in a countersuit</a> filed the next month, claiming that Sanderson was the one who hit her from behind and is now trying to "exploit her celebrity and wealth."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Gwyneth Paltrow and Terry Sanderson.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Rick Bowmer-Pool/Getty (2)</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sanderson <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>initially sued Paltrow for $3.1 million</a> in 2019, but a judge later ruled he could only sue for $300,000 in damages. Meanwhile, the actress countersued for $1 and attorney fees.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Before a jury was sworn in on Tuesday, March 21, Judge Kent R. Holmberg ruled that the jury will not hear arguments concerning an alleged "hit-and-run," as Dr. Sanderson claimed in his original 2019 lawsuit.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The judge said that he established, via evidence, that Paltrow had stopped and determined that Sanderson did not have any significant injuries before she and a ski instructor, who was with her at the time, left the scene of the incident.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On Thursday, March 30, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>the verdict was revealed</a> after the jury deliberated for less than three hours, and Paltrow was found not responsible; instead, they said Sanderson was "100 percent" at fault and harmed Paltrow in the collision.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Read on for some of the biggest revelations from the proceedings.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-both-paltrow-and-sanderson-claim-they-were-the-downhill-skier></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Both Paltrow and Sanderson claim they were the downhill skier</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Rick Bowmer/AP/Shutterstock</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Opening statements kicked off with lawyers from both sides on March 21, describing the role Paltrow and Sanderson might have played during the incident. Ski etiquette was discussed at length, a key detail at the core of the case.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to the sport's rules, the person who is further down the mountain has the right of way. "All skiers know that when they're skiing down the mountain, it's their responsibility to yield the right of way to skiers below them," Sanderson's attorney Lawrence Buhler told jurors.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, both sides claim they were the downhill skier. Paltrow's lawyer, Stephen Owens, said that the actress was skiing when she suddenly saw "two skis appear between her skis and a man comes up right behind her," adding that she thought she was being assaulted.
