The <span id=9f9ec48a-6bc6-4009-8e39-a89925e6e32c class=suggested-link>next</span> morning you wake up with a dry mouth, a raging thirst, and a <a href=#>headache</a>, possibly because the outer lining of your brain also gets dehydrated, causing tension.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Health</h2></p><p>Alcohol, particularly wines and beer, have also been found to irritate the linings of your stomach and intestines.</p><p>In response, this boosts the production of gastric acid to help you digest it, as well as enzymes and mucus to help protect itself.</p><p>This also signals to your brain that you are overloading yourself with toxins that are not good for you, making you want to be sick.</p><p>Alcohol also slows down the communication between your brain cells, slowing your reactions and making you slur your words.</p><p>As the alcohol starts to <a href=#>move out of your system</a>, your brain tries to restore the balance and starts to get active again.</p><p>This disrupts your sleep patterns, making you wake up feeling tired and grumpy the next day.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>1.

WHITE WINE = HEARTBURN AND NAUSEA</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/close-chilled-white-wine-picnic-838186273.jpg><p>White wine is made from the fermented juice of grapes stripped of their seeds and skins.</p><p>But winemakers also add sulphites - preservatives - to stop it going brown and to boost flavour.</p><p>About one in 100 people are <a href=#>allergic</a> to these, and, as a result, normal <a href=#>hangover</a> symptoms like headaches, nausea, and <a href=#>stomach pains</a>, will be much worse.</p><p>White wines are also more bitter, with many containing up to 10 per cent acid, which will have other knock-on effects.</p><p>A study published in the in the journal <a aria-label="Gastroenterology (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Gastroenterology</a> in 1983 found the high acid content tends to irritate the lining of your stomach and stop it emptying as fast.</p><p>Another in the journal Gut found white wine particularly triggers your stomach to release gastric acid.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>What kind of hangover will you get?&nbsp;</h3><p>If you’ve drunk too much white wine, you are more likely to feel nauseous or be sick because of the irritation to your stomach.</p><p>Research has also found you are more likely to suffer other symptoms like <a href=#>acid reflux</a> and <a href=#>heartburn</a> the next day.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>3.

If you don’t, it will go straight into your bloodstream.</p><p>"If you drink any type of alcohol on an empty stomach, the rate of absorption is sometimes so fast that it compares with getting it intravenously," says alcohol researcher Professor Wayne Jones.</p><p>2. <strong>Take vitamins</strong></p><p>Nutritional expert Geeta Sidhu-Robb, Founder of Nosh Detox says: ‘Your body uses essential vitamins and minerals when digesting and metabolising alcohol, leading to a depletion of vitamins and a worse hangover.</p><p>"Before a heavy night of drinking, help your liver out and take vitamin supplements, particularly Vitamin B as alcohol destroys it when consumed.’ She also advises taking them the next day too."</p><p>"This will help replenish any vitamins that were used during the metabolism of alcohol the night before."</p><p>3. <strong>Try non-alcoholic drinks</strong></p><p>We often drink automatically at social events to give ourselves ‘something to do’ or not feel left out.</p><p>The truth is that if you have a glass in your hand,&nbsp; most people don’t even notice what you are drinking.</p><p>Opt for fizzy drinks or the new range of alcohol alternatives that mimic the taste and appearance but don’t contain the main ingredient in alcohol, ethanol.</p><p>4. <strong>Try the half-half method</strong></p><p>One way to cut down is the ‘the half-and-half-method’ – where you alternate between a non-alcoholic drink and an alcoholic one, says Martin Preston Founder and Chief Executive at Private Rehab Clinic Delamere.</p><p>He says: “The ‘half-and-half’ method, isn’t about giving up alcohol altogether, but instead interspersing alcoholic drinks with non-alcoholic alternatives or water at social events.&nbsp;</p><p>"Alcohol makes the body extremely dehydrated, lowering your immune system and <span id=8c39a4d1-6a46-4e50-886b-cbb850361cdf class=suggested-link>energy</span> levels the next day.</p><p>"So, drinking glasses of water in between drinks will help keep hydration levels up and also quench your thirst, which will stop you from sipping your alcoholic drink too quickly, and leave you feeling more refreshed the next day."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57x56YpayYZIZ6f5Bwa3FnlKe2r7eMrbCpnV2ks260wKeeqK6Vp3q4tc2eZJudlad6sb7OrJycm59ixKm10qSwaA%3D%3D</p></content><div></div><section class=sk3-margin-v-full><section class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h"><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><sk3-social><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=%2fdrink-type-of-hangover-wine-beer-prosecco-whisky.html&title=What%20you%20drink%20dictates%20the%20type%20of%20hangover%20you%20endure%20-%20from%20pounding%20head%2c%20to%20the%20worst%20of%20the%20wo" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"LinkedIn","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#linkedin"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdrink-type-of-hangover-wine-beer-prosecco-whisky.html&description=What%20you%20drink%20dictates%20the%20type%20of%20hangover%20you%20endure%20-%20from%20pounding%20head%2c%20to%20the%20worst%20of%20the%20wo" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Pinterest","width=800,height=720,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#pinterest"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdrink-type-of-hangover-wine-beer-prosecco-whisky.html&title=What%20you%20drink%20dictates%20the%20type%20of%20hangover%20you%20endure%20-%20from%20pounding%20head%2c%20to%20the%20worst%20of%20the%20wo" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Reddit","width=832,height=624,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#reddit"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//t.me/share/url?url=%2fdrink-type-of-hangover-wine-beer-prosecco-whisky.html&title=What%20you%20drink%20dictates%20the%20type%20of%20hangover%20you%20endure%20-%20from%20pounding%20head%2c%20to%20the%20worst%20of%20the%20wo" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Telegram","width=800,height=600,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#telegram"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//twitter.com/intent/tweet/?url=%2fdrink-type-of-hangover-wine-beer-prosecco-whisky.html&text=What%20you%20drink%20dictates%20the%20type%20of%20hangover%20you%20endure%20-%20from%20pounding%20head%2c%20to%20the%20worst%20of%20the%20wo" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Twitter","width=800,height=450,resizable=yes,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#twitter"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//vk.com/share.php?url=%2fdrink-type-of-hangover-wine-beer-prosecco-whisky.html" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"VK","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#vk"/></svg></a></sk3-social></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><div class=sk3-margin-h><h3>Larita Shotwell</h3></div><div class="sk3-margin-h sk3-margin-down">Update: 2024-04-09</div></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./wheel-of-fortune-new-season-whirling-around.html><h3>&lt;&lt;
